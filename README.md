Function composition is where we take two functions, and combine them into one.
That is, our new function calls one function, takes the result, and passes it into another function.
In essence, it allows you to chain functions together so that the result of one function becomes the input to the next.
This new function applies the functions you compose in a specific order. 
function composition enables reusability of functionality at a very high level.

A real-world example most of us are familiar with:

Bread Slicing Function: You start by slicing the bread.
Spreading Function: Next, you spread butter, mayo, or any spread of your choice.
Filling Function: Lastly, you add the fillings â€”  tomato, cheese, and so Many More.
Each step in making a sandwich can be represented as a function. When you combine these functions, you get a composed function.
